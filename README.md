# Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
*Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a Sentiment Analysis model using Amazon's SageMaker platform in order
to determine the sentiment of a movie review. The model is a recurrent neural network using LSTM gates that was trained
on the IMDB data set.
